{"uid": "gen_000009", "instruction": "Implement a function in Python that simulates a real-time traffic flow system in a city grid. The function should accept a 2D grid representing the city's roads, where each cell can be either empty (0), occupied by a vehicle (1), or blocked (2). Vehicles move only in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) and follow a simple rule: they move one step in their current direction unless blocked. At each time step, all vehicles advance one cell in their direction. The function should continuously update the grid in a loop, simulating the flow of traffic for a specified number of time steps. Additionally, the function should detect and handle collisions\u2014when two vehicles meet in the same cell, they should both be removed from the grid. After each time step, the function should print the current state of the grid in a readable format. The simulation should be interactive, allowing the user to pause or resume the simulation using a keyboard input (e.g., pressing 'p' to pause, 'r' to resume). The simulation must also include a way to visualize the grid in real-time using ASCII characters where empty cells are represented as '\u00b7', vehicles as '\ud83d\ude97', and blocked cells as '\u2588'. The output should be styled to resemble a real-time dashboard of a smart city traffic management system. The function should return the final state of the grid after the specified number of time steps. Ensure that the simulation is both efficient and responsive.  \nThe user interface should allow for smooth interaction, where the simulation pauses when 'p' is pressed and resumes when 'r' is pressed, without interrupting the flow of the simulation logic. The system must handle edge cases such as vehicles attempting to move into blocked cells or reaching the boundaries of the grid.  \nThe simulation must account for the directional movement of vehicles (each vehicle has a direction encoded as a tuple (dx, dy)) and maintain a consistent state across all time steps. The grid dimensions should be configurable through input parameters, and the initial configuration of vehicles should be randomly generated within valid constraints.  \nThe final output must be a properly formatted grid in ASCII representation, with clear visual separation between each time step and a final summary of vehicle count changes over time.  \nThe function should be fully self-contained, require no external dependencies, and operate entirely within the Python standard library.  \nThe simulation must ensure that no two vehicles occupy the same cell during any time step, and the system should detect and resolve collisions immediately upon occurrence.  \nAll inputs should be validated to ensure the grid dimensions are positive integers and the vehicle count does not exceed the grid capacity.  \nThe function should also log every time step, showing the vehicle count before and after movement and collision resolution, to provide transparency to the simulation's behavior.  \nThe system must be designed to prevent infinite loops and must terminate cleanly when the specified number of time steps is reached or when the user chooses to stop the simulation.  \nThe function should support keyboard input in a non-blocking manner, using a simple polling mechanism.  \nEnsure that the simulation runs efficiently even for moderately sized grids (e.g., up to 20x20 cells), with no unnecessary computational overhead.  \nThe function must return the final state of the grid, and any intermediate states are only for display purposes.  \nThe simulation must account for the possibility of vehicles moving into other vehicles or blocked cells, and the movement logic should respect the physical boundaries of the grid.  \nAll vehicle directions should be updated only after the movement and collision resolution process is complete.  \nThe function should maintain a consistent time step interval (e.g., 1 second per update), and the visual output should update in real-time to reflect the current state.  \nThe system must prevent vehicles from continuing to move beyond the grid boundaries.  \nEach time step should be logged with a timestamp (e.g., \"Time step 5: vehicles before: 10 \u2192 vehicles after: 8\") and clearly display the grid in ASCII format.  \nThe simulation should support graceful recovery from invalid inputs and ensure that all operations are thread-safe when using a shared state.  \nThe function should be designed to scale to larger grids while maintaining readability and responsiveness.  \nThe final grid state should be returned as a 2D list of integers representing the traffic state.  \nThis simulation should demonstrate a real-world application of discrete event simulation in smart city infrastructure.  \nAll edge cases, including empty grids, maximum vehicle density, and edge movement, should be handled gracefully.  \nThe function should be fully documented with comments explaining each major step of the simulation, and the code should be written in a clean, readable, and maintainable style.  \nThe simulation must include a safety check to prevent excessive vehicle counts that could lead to performance degradation or memory issues.  \nThe system must also detect and report when a vehicle reaches a dead end and stops moving, but this is optional and not required for the core functionality.  \nThe function should support a minimum of 1x1 grid and a maximum of 20x20 grid size.  \nAll vehicle movement must be deterministic and consistent across runs.  \nThe function should allow the user to input a custom number of time steps and the grid size, and validate all inputs before proceeding.  \nThe simulation must be interactive and responsive, with clear visual feedback for each time step.  \nThe user should be able to see the total number of vehicles at each step, the grid state, and the ability to pause/resume.  \nThe function should return the final state of the grid after the specified number of time steps.  \nThe simulation must include error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., negative grid size or zero time steps).  \nThe function should ensure that no vehicle movement results in a duplicate cell unless explicitly allowed by the collision resolution rule.  \nThe function should not use any external libraries beyond Python's standard library.  \nThe simulation should be designed to be both educational and practical, showcasing how real-world systems can be modeled using programming.  \nThe final output should include a summary of the total number of vehicles at the beginning and end of the simulation.  \nThe function should be robust and handle all edge cases, including empty grids, full grids, and grids with only blocked cells.  \nThe system must ensure that all vehicles are properly removed from the grid when a collision occurs, and no ghost vehicles remain.  \nThe function should be designed with clarity and maintainability in mind, making it easy to extend or modify for other traffic scenarios.  \nThe simulation should run in a loop until the specified number of time steps is reached or the user presses 'q' to quit.  \nThe function should support custom vehicle directions, including up, down, left, right, and diagonals (optional).  \nThe function should be self-contained and require no external file inputs or outputs.  \nAll movement logic should be deterministic and repeatable.  \nThe function should not assume any specific grid size or initial configuration; it should be general-purpose and adaptable.  \nThe system must prevent vehicles from moving into cells that are already occupied by another vehicle or blocked cells.  \nThe function should maintain the integrity of the grid state across all time steps.  \nThe simulation must include a visual feedback mechanism that updates in real-time, allowing users to observe the traffic flow dynamically.  \nThe function should be fully tested with edge cases and provided in a single, coherent block of code.  \nThe final state of the grid should be returned as a 2D list of integers.  \nThe simulation should be designed to demonstrate the principles of real-time systems and discrete event simulation.  \nAll movements should be processed in parallel, but collision detection should occur after all vehicles have attempted to move.  \nThe function should ensure that the grid state is updated only after complete collision resolution.  \nThe function should be able to handle large numbers of vehicles (up to 1000) without performance degradation.  \nThe simulation should be run in a non-blocking manner, allowing for smooth interaction with the keyboard.  \nThe function should not crash or hang when encountering invalid inputs or edge cases.  \nThe system must ensure that the simulation terminates cleanly and returns the final state.  \nThe final grid should be printed in a clean, readable format with clear visual separation between time steps.  \nThe function should
