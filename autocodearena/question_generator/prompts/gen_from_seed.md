## Task
Design a **Coding Assessment Question** that matches the style of provided examples.

## Objective
Analyze the provided sample questions and create an additional question that:
- Aligns with the existing set in terms of **style, complexity, and scope**
- Is unique and not a simple rephrasing of existing questions
- Tests similar programming concepts but with a different problem scenario

## Guidelines

### Question Style
- Carefully examine the format and presentation of the given questions
- Maintain consistent tone and language used in the original set
- Match the level of detail and explanation

### Question Length
- Ensure your new question is of **comparable length** to the existing ones
- If the original questions vary in length, aim for the **average length**

### Difficulty Level
- Assess the cognitive and technical challenges in the sample questions
- **Match the complexity** of concepts, algorithms, or programming techniques required
- Similar time required to solve

### Topic Alignment
- Identify the core programming concepts or domains covered
- Create a question that explores a **related or complementary area** within the same topic
- Use the same application domain if possible

### Question Uniqueness
- Ensure the question is **meaningfully different** from existing ones
- Introduce a **novel problem or scenario** that tests the same skills in a different context
- Avoid slight modifications of existing questions

## Sample Questions
{SAMPLE_QUESTIONS}

## Output Format
Output **one new question only**. 
- Do NOT include question number or any label
- Do NOT include any explanation or metadata
- Output ONLY the question text
- Make it clear, complete, and self-contained
