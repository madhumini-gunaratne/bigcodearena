{"uid": "7c9523709afe4f6dbb397d106443507c", "instruction": "## 1. Overview\nThe goal is to build an MVP demonstrating core functionalities:\n- Donation & Funding Management\n- Real-Time Resource Inventory Tracking\n- Optimization & Allocation Engine\n- Logistics & Distribution Coordination\n- Reporting & Analytics Dashboard\n\nThe system must be modular, secure, scalable, and data-driven, integrating real-time data from campus networks and external APIs (payment gateways, mapping services, etc.).\n\n## 2. System Architecture\n\n### 2.1 High-Level Components\n- **Frontend:** \n  - Web portal built with React.\n  - Mobile app built with Flutter for field coordinators.\n  \n- **Backend Services:** \n  - RESTful API layer (choose either Node.js/Express or Python with FastAPI).\n  - Optimization service (Python-based, using PuLP or Google OR-Tools).\n  - Notification service using websockets or push notifications.\n  \n- **Database:**\n  - **Relational Database:** PostgreSQL for transactional data (donations, users, allocation logs).\n  - **NoSQL/Real-Time Store:** Firebase or Redis for real-time inventory and field updates.\n  \n- **External Integrations:** \n  - Payment gateways (e.g., Paystack or Flutterwave).\n  - Mapping & Routing APIs (e.g., Google Maps API).\n  - SMS/Push notification APIs for alerts.\n\n### 2.2 Deployment & Infrastructure\n- Deploy on a cloud provider (AWS/GCP/Azure) using containerization (Docker) for each microservice.\n- Set up a CI/CD pipeline (using GitHub Actions or Jenkins).\n- Use monitoring and logging tools (Prometheus/Grafana or ELK stack).\n\n## 3. Module Design & Implementation Details\n\n### 3.1 Donation & Funding Management Module\n- **API Endpoints:**\n  - `POST /donations`: Process a new donation (validate payment, record donor info).\n  - `GET /donations`: Retrieve donation history (with filters).\n  - `GET /funds`: Get current fund balance and allocation status.\n  \n- **Implementation:**\n  - Integrate with a payment processor (Stripe/Paystack SDK) and use webhooks for transaction confirmation.\n  - Create database tables:\n    - `donors (donor_id, name, email, contact_info)`\n    - `donations (donation_id, donor_id, amount, currency, timestamp, status)`\n  - Enforce security with HTTPS, OAuth/JWT authentication, and PCI-DSS compliance.\n\n### 3.2 Resource Inventory Tracking Module\n- **API Endpoints:**\n  - `GET /inventory`: Get current resource levels per campus/distribution center.\n  - `POST /inventory/update`: Update inventory levels (for field coordinators).\n  - `GET /inventory/logs`: Retrieve audit logs of inventory changes.\n  \n- **Implementation:**\n  - Use Firebase or Redis Pub/Sub for real-time updates.\n  - Data model example:\n    - `inventory (location_id, resource_type, quantity, last_updated)`\n  - Integrate with university databases (via REST API or ETL jobs).\n\n### 3.3 Optimization & Allocation Engine\n- **Purpose:** Optimize allocation of resources (or funds) to campuses based on demand, supply, and logistics.\n  \n- **Algorithm:**\n  - **Decision Variables:** Define \\( x_{ij} \\) = quantity of resource allocated from source \\( i \\) to campus \\( j \\).\n  - **Objective:** Minimize total cost (or maximize coverage). For example:\n    \\[\n    \\min \\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} \\cdot x_{ij}\n    \\]\n    where \\( c_{ij} \\) represents the cost (or time) to transport resources.\n  - **Constraints:**\n    - Supply: \\(\\sum_j x_{ij} \\leq S_i\\) for each source \\( i \\).\n    - Demand: \\(\\sum_i x_{ij} \\geq D_j\\) for each campus \\( j \\).\n    - Non-negativity: \\( x_{ij} \\geq 0 \\).\n  \n- **Implementation Steps:**\n  1. Ingest real-time inventory and demand data.\n  2. Set up the linear programming model using Python (PuLP or OR-Tools).\n  3. Create an API endpoint `POST /optimize` that accepts current data and returns the allocation plan.\n  \n- **Sample Pseudocode:**\n```python\nimport pulp\n\ndef optimize_allocation(supply, demand, cost):\n    prob = pulp.LpProblem(\"ResourceAllocation\", pulp.LpMinimize)\n    x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts(\"alloc\", [(w, c) for w in supply for c in demand], lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\n    prob += pulp.lpSum([cost[w][c] * x[(w, c)] for w in supply for c in demand])\n    for w in supply:\n        prob += pulp.lpSum([x[(w, c)] for c in demand]) <= supply[w]\n    for c in demand:\n        prob += pulp.lpSum([x[(w, c)] for w in supply]) >= demand[c]\n    prob.solve()\n    return {(w, c): x[(w, c)].varValue for w in supply for c in demand}\n\n3.4 Logistics & Distribution Module\n\t\u2022\tAPI Endpoints:\n\t\u2022\tPOST /logistics/plan: Accept the allocation plan and generate delivery routes.\n\t\u2022\tGET /logistics/status: Retrieve current delivery statuses.\n\t\u2022\tPOST /logistics/update: Allow field agents to update delivery status.\n\t\u2022\tImplementation:\n\t\u2022\tIntegrate with Google Maps API for route optimization (consider real-time traffic).\n\t\u2022\tDevelop scheduling algorithms for coordinating multiple deliveries.\n\t\u2022\tData model example:\n\t\u2022\tdeliveries (delivery_id, source_id, destination_id, scheduled_time, status, route_details)\n\n3.5 Reporting & Analytics Dashboard\n\t\u2022\tAPI Endpoints:\n\t\u2022\tGET /reports/summary: Provide an overview of funds, allocations, and deliveries.\n\t\u2022\tGET /reports/inventory: Retrieve historical inventory data.\n\t\u2022\tGET /reports/donations: Get detailed donation and fund usage metrics.\n\t\u2022\tImplementation:\n\t\u2022\tBuild the dashboard using React and libraries like Chart.js.\n\t\u2022\tAggregate data from PostgreSQL and real-time sources.\n\t\u2022\tEnsure role-based access to sensitive data.\n\n4. Database Schema & Data Modeling\n\n4.1 PostgreSQL Schema Examples\n\t\u2022\tUsers Table:\n\nCREATE TABLE users (\n  user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,\n  role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL  -- (e.g., admin, donor, field_agent)\n);\n\n\t\u2022\tDonations Table:\n\nCREATE TABLE donations (\n  donation_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  donor_id INT REFERENCES users(user_id),\n  amount NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL,\n  currency VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,\n  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL  -- (e.g., pending, completed, failed)\n);\n\n\t\u2022\tInventory Table:\n\nCREATE TABLE inventory (\n  inventory_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  location_id INT NOT NULL,\n  resource_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n  quantity INT NOT NULL,\n  last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n\n\t\u2022\tAllocation Logs Table:\n\nCREATE TABLE allocations (\n  allocation_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  location_id INT NOT NULL,\n  allocated_quantity INT NOT NULL,\n  allocation_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n  details JSONB\n);\n\n4.2 Real-Time Data Store (Firebase/Redis)\n\t\u2022\tUse for:\n\t\u2022\tReal-time inventory updates.\n\t\u2022\tDelivery status tracking.\n\t\u2022\tPush notifications.\n\n5. Integration with External Services\n\t\u2022\tPayment Gateways: Integrate via REST/SDK (set up webhook endpoints like POST /webhooks/payment).\n\t\u2022\tMapping & Routing: Use Google Maps Directions API and cache frequent routes.\n\t\u2022\tNotification Services: Integrate SMS gateways or Firebase Cloud Messaging for alerts.\n\n6.

Think of elements like leetspeak, the Matrix code waterfall effect, and the general vibe of early internet subcultures. However, the final result should feel modern and contemporary, not like a website directly from the 90s. It's about capturing the spirit and essence of that era and reimagining it for today.\n\nConsiderations (Interpret these freely and creatively):\n\nLeetspeak: How can you subtly or cleverly incorporate leetspeak elements without making the page feel dated or unreadable?\n\nMatrix Waterfall: Explore how to create a modern and visually interesting take on the Matrix code waterfall. This could be in the background, as part of the content, or in some other innovative way.\n\nModern Design Principles: Ensure the landing page is still functional and visually appealing by today's standards. Think about responsiveness, clean layouts, and user experience.\n\n\"CyberNexus\" Concept: Imagine what \"CyberNexus\" is. Is it a community? A tool? A platform for something specific? Let this imagined concept inform your design and content (even if placeholder).\n\nOutput: Provide the complete HTML, CSS, and any necessary JavaScript code to create this landing page.
