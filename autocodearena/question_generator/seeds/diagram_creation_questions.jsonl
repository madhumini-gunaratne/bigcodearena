{"uid": "4b26439b76e042fe892487133d50d9c4", "instruction": "Create a Mermaid Quadrant Chart that effectively categorizes a dataset into four distinct quadrants, ensuring each quadrant has a meaningful label that reflects the data\u2019s context. The chart should have a clear title that explains its purpose, and both the X-axis and Y-axis must be labeled with descriptive names and units where applicable. Ensure that the axes intersect at the appropriate origin point, and define at least six data points, each placed in different quadrants to create a balanced distribution. Each data point should be distinctly labeled with a meaningful name, ensuring clarity in representation. Additionally, assign custom colors to different quadrants to enhance visual distinction, ensuring that colors follow a logical pattern (e.g., warm colors for higher values, cool colors for lower values). Utilize dashed or solid grid lines to improve readability and apply custom styling where possible, such as modifying point sizes or emphasizing critical areas. If relevant, include an annotated reference line or additional markers to indicate thresholds or key performance benchmarks. The final visualization should be structured, visually appealing, and correctly formatted to render without errors in a Mermaid-supported environment.", "category": "diagram_creation"}

Each event should include the year, a brief description, and where applicable, the name of the spacecraft or mission. Use different colors or styling to differentiate between national space agencies (NASA, Roscosmos, ESA, CNSA, ISRO, etc.) and private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin. Make sure the timeline flows chronologically with well-spaced intervals and clearly marked years.
